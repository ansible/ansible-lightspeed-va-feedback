# ansible-lightspeed-va-feedback

**Overview**

The Ansible Lightspeed team is making available, for internal use, a Virtual Assistant (VA)/chatbot that is intended to be used for asking questions related to Ansible and the Ansible Automation Platform.

We are releasing an MVP version of the VA to all Red Hat associates via a temporary website. 

*We are looking for users to try it out and provide feedback.*

This first release of the VA is aimed at answering questions that would be discovered through the AAP documentation, specifically AAP 2.5, Ansible on Cloud, and Ansible Lightspeed.

The intent is to eventually provide the VA to our customers, integrated directly into the AAP Unified UI (not a website). Over time, more features will be added to the VA where it can evaluate questions about the existing AAP environment, nodes, job failures, etc.
